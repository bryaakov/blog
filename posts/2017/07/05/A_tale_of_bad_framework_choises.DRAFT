#and how it led to interesting code
One of the most interesting pieces of code in CM-Well, IMO, is the [http client util code](https://github.com/thomsonreuters/CM-Well/blob/3a9eae23c5d17d4b1606f604a1c822ce884d88df/server/cmwell-util/src/main/scala/cmwell/util/http/SimpleHttpClient.scala). In short, it defines an API for a http client, and wraps akka-http which serves as the "http client engine".
Why not just use akka's API, you might ask...? Well, we'll get there, but first, a bit of history.

##A long time ago
(In a galaxy far far away) CM-Well was written mostly in java (oh boy... in fact, it started out as a POC with python &amp; django, and only later was implemented in java &amp; scala). Only the frontend was written in scala, and the scala eco-system looked very different than what it is today. The most popular scala web framework at the time was [lift](http://liftweb.net). No one heard of [play!](http://playframework.com) back then (it was very new, maybe 1.0 or 1.1). And it was decided to write the CM-Well web service with lift. But not only the web service... You see, lift classes were already on the classpath. Especially lift's _HttpSupport_ from the testkit, which had reasonable API. So all of CM-Well's integration tests were written using it. It served it's purpose, and tests kept pilling up, until we decided to upgrade scala from 2.9 to 2.10. lift was holding us back, and play started to look more and more attractive. We replaced lift with play! but decided to rewrite the integration tests without using play's testkit or http client, after all, what if down the road we would want to replace it with something else? We didn't want to be tied up to much to the web framework, so we minimized our dependency in play as much as possible. For the integration tests, we decided to go with a popular scala http client instead. The infamous [Dispatch](http://dispatch.databinder.net) (don't judge... back then it was popular). For those who are not familiar with dispatch, it's a scala http client library, which makes heavy use of symbolic operators (check out the [Periodic Table](http://www.flotsam.nl/dispatch-periodic-table.html)). Other than making the code less readable with all those fancy operators to new-comers, it served it's purpose pretty good. That is until... yup. It was time to upgrade again, and move from scala 2.10 to 2.11. And again, our integration tests (and other code that made use of an http client), were written with a library that didn't move fast enough. It held us back, causing a "jar hell" of unwanted dependencies... and we grew tired of all the weird operators. But no one wanted to rewrite all the tests again... that's a lot of dirty work. We hacked, and managed to get by with using it only in tests, so at least we didn't had the jar hell on our main artifacts classpath, just in tests. Other code in main artifacts that did need to use a http client, used whatever we had on the classpath directly. Be it play's WS, or [spray](http://spray.io), it didn't really mattered. But time went by, and tests kept pilling up, and it was way due to clean the code. Being a bit wiser from the bad experience, we decided to make sure that tests code will never hold us back again from changing libraries and frameworks. We decided to write a thin wrapper with a sane & simple http client API. but wrapper for what? well... it doesn't matter. That was the whole point; it it's small enough, we can always change the underlying library, and won't have to patch up thousands lines of testing code if we ever switch to another library. Anyway, we needed to pick up something, and at the time, we were really excited about the recent developments in akka. It was 2015, and the akka-stream & akka-http experimental modules came out. We decided to check it out, but the experimental modules were too risky for production code, which made it a perfect candidate to serve in our tests as a dispatch replacement, without affecting production code. This was 2 birds in 1 stone - evaluating an interesting technology in it's early stages, with real code, without risking anything crucial, and using our thin wrapper to decouple test's logic from the http client library.
_P.S. to be on the safe side, and for the sport of it, we started to implement the same thin API on top of [ning's AsyncHttpClient](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client), but never really continued with it, since akka-http got the job done perfectly. But some [remnants stayed commented out in the sources](https://github.com/thomsonreuters/CM-Well/blob/3a9eae23c5d17d4b1606f604a1c822ce884d88df/server/cmwell-util/src/main/scala/cmwell/util/http/SimpleHttpClient.scala#L405-L487), waiting for the day that will never come._

##We &#x2764; Akka-http
Choosing akka was challenging. It introduces this new concept of streams, which, at least in tests, we wanted to abstract away for simplicity. But then again, just consuming everything eagerly, hiding completely the reactive nature of the API, and returning a future of response when everything is done, is asking for performance troubles. We needed a simple default, with an easy way of exploiting the asynchrony &amp; reactive capabilities of akka-http. For that, we made heavy use of type classes, in a slightly adapted version of what is known as the [magnet pattern](http://spray.io/blog/2012-12-13-the-magnet-pattern).

##The gory details
Let's see some code, shall we..? starting with the API itself:
```scala
object SimpleHttpClient {
  
  // web sockets API is more complex, and out of the scope for this post,
  // but is shown here for completeness, as it is part of the API.
  // You are more than welcome to check out the source code.
  def ws[T : SimpleMessageHandler](uri: String,
         initiationMessage: T,
         subprotocol: Option[String] = None,
         queryParams: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil,
         headers: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil)(react: T => Option[T])
        (implicit ec: ExecutionContext, 
         as: ActorSystem = this.sys, 
         mat: Materializer = this.mat) = ...

  def get[T : SimpleResponseHandler](uri: String,
          queryParams: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil,
          headers: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil)
         (implicit ec: ExecutionContext, 
          as: ActorSystem = this.sys, 
          mat: Materializer = this.mat) = ...

  def put[T : SimpleResponseHandler](uri: String,
          body: Body,
          contentType: Option[String] = None,
          queryParams: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil,
          headers: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil)
         (implicit ec: ExecutionContext, 
          as: ActorSystem = this.sys, 
          mat: Materializer = this.mat) = ...

  def post[T : SimpleResponseHandler](uri: String,
           body: Body,
           contentType: Option[String] = None,
           queryParams: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil,
           headers: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil)
          (implicit ec: ExecutionContext, 
           as: ActorSystem = this.sys, 
           mat: Materializer = this.mat) = ...

  def delete[T : SimpleResponseHandler](uri: String,
             queryParams: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil,
             headers: Seq[(String,String)] = Nil)
            (implicit ec: ExecutionContext, 
             as: ActorSystem = this.sys, 
             mat: Materializer = this.mat) = ...

}
```
Overall, this looks like a pretty straight forward http client API. Let's try to clear the fog from the unclear parts:
Each of the methods returns a _Future[SimpleResponse[T]]_. I know what you might be thinking... I said **simple** API, and here I am, showing some fancy code with weird classes, right...? I'll list down what might be interesting here:

* _implicit as: ActorSystem = this.sys_ &amp; _mat: Materializer = this.mat_
* _Body_
* _SimpleResponse[T]_ &amp; _SimpleResponseHandler_

###ActorSystem &amp; Materializer
In akka-http, in order to handle http requests & reponses, you'll need to get a hold of a _HttpExt_, which takes an _ActorSystem_ in _Http_ factory method. Also, a connection flow to build the request graph around it is needed. To make things simple, we use _superPool_ which returns a flow that routes all requests to a cached host connection pool, and is managed by akka. It needs a _Materializer_. We also need a _Materializer_ for running a simple graph per request. something like:

```scala
Source.single(request -> context).via(connectionPool).runWith(Sink.head)
```
Which performs the request and return a _Future[Try[HttpResponse]]_.
Finally, we'll need the _Materializer_ to handle akka's _HttpResponse_, which returns the payload in the form of _Source[ByteString,\_]_. Remember, we wanted to abstract away anything that binds us to the library, so we can't leak (unless we want to, more on that is to follow) akka's classes. Not _Source_ nor _ByteString_. We need to convert it to something else.
Anyway, as you can see, it's needed. But if you pay attention, you'll see it has default values. This let's us provide reasonable defaults, which can be configured freely using standard typesafe's config. The provided _reference.conf_ only defines the bare minimum:

```sh
cmwell.util.http {
  akka {
    actor {
      provider = "akka.actor.LocalActorRefProvider"
    }
    http {
      host-connection-pool {
        max-open-requests = 1024
      }
    }
  }
}
```
And as you might have already guessed, the provided actor system is configured using:

```scala
ActorSystem("SimpleHttpClient",ConfigFactory.load().getConfig("cmwell.util.http"))
```
Also, the provided _Materializer_ &amp; _ActorSystem_ are **LAZY** (as in lazy val), So it won't even get instantiated if this code is run within production code which makes sure to supply a fully configured _ActorSystem_ &amp; _Materializer_. But, you might ask: isn't this binds us to akka? well, technically, yes. in practice, materializer and actor system are passed implicitly, so it's not written in code (keeping aside some very rare cases). I.E: in the tests, you don't see any reference to any materializer or actor system, and we are still loosely coupled, thanks to scala being such a flexible language when it comes to defaults &amp; implicits.

###Body
The _post_ &amp; _put_ methods also take a mysterious _body: Body_, so what is it? Of course, as the name suggests it's the request body. But, you might ask: Should a user be troubled with creating such objects? The answer is no. The _Body_ companion object hosts some pretty useful implicits:

```scala
sealed trait Body {
  def entity(contentType: Option[String]): RequestEntity
  def contentType(ct: String): akka.http.scaladsl.model.ContentType = ...
}

object Body {
  import scala.language.implicitConversions

  implicit def apply(body: String): Body = new BodyFromString(body)
  implicit def apply(body: Array[Byte]): Body = new BodyFromBytes(body)
  implicit def apply(body: ByteString): Body = new BodyFromByteString(body)

  private class BodyFromString(body: String) extends Body {  ...  }
  private class BodyFromBytes(body: Array[Byte]) extends Body {  ...  }
  private class BodyFromByteString(body: ByteString) extends Body {  ...  }
}
```
This means, that you may pass the body argument as whatever you want, be it a _String_, a _Array[Byte]_ or even akka's _ByteString_. If the need arises, it's very easy to add more automatically acceptable types. We can just add another implicit conversion in _Body_'s companion object. or, if it's a special case, then just instantiate a new _Body_ locally.
